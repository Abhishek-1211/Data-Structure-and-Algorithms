# Data-Structure-and-Algorithms
Before we delve dee into Data structure and Algorithms,there are some basic terminalogies  we must be aware of.These include
  1.what is Data ?
  2.what is Data-Structure ?
  3.what do you mean by Problem statement ?
  4.what do you mean by Algorithm
  5.what is a Program ?
  
So, when we use the term Data-We actually mean any random value(or set of values)like-say 25 or "ramesh".This randomness differentiate a Data from a Information.When this data gets contextualised it becomes information.Suppose i rewrite the above 2 values as "Ramesh's Age=25".Now there is context attached to both the values.It becomes information.Thus,Information is Processed Data or meaningful data.
Data Structure are just ways to organise these data to perform certain operations on them more efficiently.These operations may include-Searching,sorting,Storing,etc.In other words Data structures are nothing but Containers that store data just like you lunch box to store food items.
The whole idea about this course is to improve problem solving skills.You'll be given certain Problem-statement which you need to solve using most approriate data structure and Algorithms.So,it is of paramount importance to understand what exactly we mean when we say"Problem statement".
Any Problem-statement is nothing but "Specification of Input-Output relationship".for example-Suppose we have to write a program that takes number and produces its factorial like below
    Input-0,1,2,3,4,5,...
    Output-1,1,2,6,24,120...
 Thus you can see for this problem statement when input is 0,output is 1.When input is 4 ,output is 24
 
Now,how we are able to achieve this desired Input-output relationship is our Algorithm.Thus these are Steps/techniques to achive predefined I/o relationship.When these Algorithms are expressed in specific syntactical manner these are called PROGRAMS.
